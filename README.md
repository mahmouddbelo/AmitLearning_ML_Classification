# Amit Learning ML Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning classification project completed as part of my learning journey with **Amit Learning**. The project focuses on solving a classification problem using various machine learning models, data preprocessing techniques, and performance evaluation methods.

## üìù Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to predict the target class using different classification algorithms and techniques, including:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Class Balancing:** Applying **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to handle imbalanced classes.
- **Model Training:** Building and training multiple models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to find the best-performing classifier.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and preprocessed the data for better model performance. This included:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Scaling numerical features

2. **Class Balancing:** The dataset was imbalanced, so I used **SMOTE** to generate synthetic samples from the minority class and balance the data.

3. **Model Implementation:**
   - Built and trained multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM.
   - Compared the models to choose the best performing one.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of each model.
   - Selected the most suitable model for prediction tasks.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for this project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **scikit-learn**: For model training, evaluation, and applying **SMOTE**.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For visualizing the data and model results.

## üìä Results

The project involved rigorous testing and evaluation of different machine learning models to find the best classifier. After applying SMOTE and tuning the models, I achieved improved classification performance.
