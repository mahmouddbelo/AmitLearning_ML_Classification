# AmitLearning_ML_Classification
This project is part of my learning experience with Amit Learning. It focuses on building, evaluating, and optimizing classification models using machine learning techniques. The project involves real-world data preprocessing, class balancing with SMOTE, and model comparison to determine the best performance for predicting categorical outcomes.
